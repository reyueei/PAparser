This is a parser for my e-gizmo power analyzer

In Arduino microcontroller, the clock cycle is 16MHz. That means (one cycle/instruction every 62.5ns). 
It takes 16,000 instructions to execute for an Arduino microcontroller to transmit a single character over the serial line at specific 
baud rate(i.e. 9600).
This code aims to lessen and optimize the code as possible to achieve a more responsive and ideal output.
